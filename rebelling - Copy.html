	Jordans are a very popular shoe now and has been for over 50 years. They are known to be very expensive and having a different variety of shoes. The downside is that the shoes were originally made for basketball, but people now wear them for show instead.. Not even playing basketball in them. Jordans have a different variety of styles, but you can see that most of the color schemes are the same for every shoe 1-22.Black, white, red, blue, grey...plus most of the Jordans selling now have already came out years beforehand. After a good wear you have to worry about them getting creased, the outsole or whole shoe turning yellow, them getting scuffed, etc. Why pay for a $160-$300 shoe to mess up so quickly?

	It's always an argrument about which shoe is better and we all know the evidence clearly shows Vans are. The have a variety of everything and different styles to match everyone's look. Van's look good on everybody, they aren't to bulky, not to small, they are the perfect fit.
