    "Vans first launched in 1966 in Anaheim, CA as The Van Doren Rubber Company. Doren noticed that shoe manufacturers were making pennies per shoe sold, while retailers took home the bulk. It took a year to set up the first factory. The men used old machinery to build the factory from scratch. 17 people came to the store on opening day. For years Doren refused to spend money on advertising. However, after a few years in business he paid professional skateboarder Stacy Peralta $300 to wear Vans during contests. Because Vans were popular amongst skateboarders, Doren decided to sponsor the best skaters he could find, which were mostly broke teens who would’ve simply accepted free shoes. The turning point for Vans was when a representative from Universal asked for a few pairs of their popular checkerboard slip-ons to use in an upcoming movie.In the early 1980s, after a great few years in business, Doren insisted that Vans create shoes for other sports like basketball, running, and even breakdancing.The expansion didn’t work. Costs were too high and they eventually filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Then in 1988 a group of investors bought Vans for $60 million. But according to Doren, the investors didn’t understand the right way to manufacturer shoes.Sales decreased and Vans fell into a slump. So in the 1990s, Vans shifted its focus from being a manufacturing company to a marketing company. To kick things off, they started by putting on the Vans Warped Tour. Then they began heavily sponsoring other extreme sporting events and athletes. Now, after 50 years of business, the company is selling $400m worth of shoes a year."
